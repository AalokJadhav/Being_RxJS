##  RxJs Practice

  In this Project I complete all RxJS Operator to master in RxJS.
****
## Live [Demo](https://being-rxjs.herokuapp.com/promise)
****

A single page application with all RxJS Operator Examples, developed using Angular 11 for front-end.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version ~11.2.3.

**Please support this project by simply putting a Github star ‚≠ê. üôè Thanks**

## Development environment

    1. Angular CLI
    2. Angular 11
    3. Bootstrap
    4. RxJS
    5. VS Code Editor

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
